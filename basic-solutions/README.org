* Solutions

** Basic01: loading your first BPF program

This lesson doesn't contain any assignments except to repeat the steps listed
in the lesson readme file.

** Basic02: loading a program by name

*** Assignment 1: Setting up your test lab

No code is needed, just repeat the steps listed in the assignment description.

*** Assignment 2: Add xdp_abort program

Just add the following section to the
[[file:../basic02-prog-by-name/xdp_prog_kern.c][xdp_prog_kern.c]] program and
follow the steps listed in the assignment description:
#+begin_example c
SEC("xdp_abort")
int  xdp_abort_func(struct xdp_md *ctx)
{
    return XDP_ABORTED;
}
#+end_example

** Basic03: counting with BPF maps

The solutions to all three assignments can be found in the following files:

 * The [[file:../basic04-pinning-maps/common_kern_user.h][common_kern_user.h]] file contains the new structure =datarec= definition.
 * The [[file:../basic04-pinning-maps/xdp_prog_kern.c][xdp_prog_kern.c]] file contains the new =xdp_stats_map= map definition and the updated =xdp_stats_record_action= function.

Note that for use in later lessons/assignments the code was moved to the following files:
[[file:../common/xdp_stats_kern_user.h][xdp_stats_kern_user.h]] and
[[file:../common/xdp_stats_kern.h][xdp_stats_kern.h]]. So in order to use the
=xdp_stats_record_action= function in later XDP programs, just include the
following header files:
#+begin_example c
#include "../common/xdp_stats_kern_user.h"
#include "../common/xdp_stats_kern.h"
#+end_example
For a user-space application, only the former header is needed.

** Basic04: pinning of maps

*** Assignment 1: (xdp_stats.c) reload map file-descriptor

See the [[file:xdp_stats.c][xdp_stats.c]] program in this directory.

*** Assignment 2: (xdp_loader.c) reuse pinned map

See the [[file:xdp_loader.c][xdp_loader.c]] program in this directory.
